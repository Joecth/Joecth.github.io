4. **Video and Thumbnail storage:** We need to store video and thumbnail files in some distributed file storage.
5. **User Database:** We would need some database to store userâ€™s information, e.g., name, email, address, etc.
6. **Video metadata storage:** Metadata database will store all the information about videos like title, file path in the system, uploading user, total views, likes, dislikes, etc. Also, it will be used to store all the video comments.
