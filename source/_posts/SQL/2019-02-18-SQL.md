### Write the following queries:

**1.**

Getting started, take a look at the `startups` table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM startups;
```

How many columns are there?

Stuck? Get a hint

**2.**

Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

Hint

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM startups;
```

There are 70 companies in the table.

**3.**

We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.

Calculate this by getting the `SUM()` of the `valuation` column.

Hint

```sql
SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;
```

The sum is $974,455,790,000!

**4.**

What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

Return the maximum amount of money `raised`.

Hint

```sql
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups;
```

**5.**

Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money `raised`, during ‘Seed’ stage.

Hint

```sql
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';
```

**6.**

In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

Hint

```sql
SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;
```

### Let's find out the valuations among different sectors:

**7.**

Return the average `valuation`.

Stuck? Get a hint

**8.**

Return the average `valuation`, in each `category`.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

**9.**

Return the average `valuation`, in each `category`.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

**10.**

Return the average `valuation`, in each `category`.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

Health Care startups seem to have higher valuations than other categories.

### What are the most competitive markets?

**11.**

First, return the name of each `category` with the total number of companies that belong to it.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

**12.**

Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.

What are the most competitive markets?

Hint

Because you are filtering on a condition that has an aggregate function, you need to use `HAVING` instead of `WHERE`:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startupss
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

If you want to go a step further, sort the result using `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

The most competitive markets are:

1. Social
2. Mobile
3. Education

### Let's see if there's a difference in startups sizes among different locations:

**13.**

What is the average size of a startup in each `location`?

Hint

```sql
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location;
```

**14.**

What is the average size of a startup in each `location`, with average sizes above 500?

Hint

```sql
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
```
