### Write the following queries:

**1.**

Getting started, take a look at the `startups` table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM startups;
```

How many columns are there?

Stuck? Get a hint

**2.**

Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

Hint

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM startups;
```

There are 70 companies in the table.

**3.**

We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.

Calculate this by getting the `SUM()` of the `valuation` column.

Hint

```sql
SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;
```

The sum is $974,455,790,000!

**4.**

What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

Return the maximum amount of money `raised`.

Hint

```sql
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups;
```

**5.**

Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money `raised`, during ‘Seed’ stage.

Hint

```sql
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';
```

**6.**

In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

Hint

```sql
SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;
```

### Let's find out the valuations among different sectors:

**7.**

Return the average `valuation`.

Stuck? Get a hint

**8.**

Return the average `valuation`, in each `category`.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

**9.**

Return the average `valuation`, in each `category`.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

**10.**

Return the average `valuation`, in each `category`.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

Health Care startups seem to have higher valuations than other categories.

### What are the most competitive markets?

**11.**

First, return the name of each `category` with the total number of companies that belong to it.

Hint

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

**12.**

Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.

What are the most competitive markets?

Hint

Because you are filtering on a condition that has an aggregate function, you need to use `HAVING` instead of `WHERE`:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startupss
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

If you want to go a step further, sort the result using `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

The most competitive markets are:

1. Social
2. Mobile
3. Education

### Let's see if there's a difference in startups sizes among different locations:

**13.**

What is the average size of a startup in each `location`?

Hint

```sql
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location;
```

**14.**

What is the average size of a startup in each `location`, with average sizes above 500?

Hint

```sql
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
```





## Multiple Tables with REBU

LEARN SQL

# Multiple Tables with REBU

Let’s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a data analyst at REBU, a ridesharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

- `trips` - trips information
- `riders` - users data
- `cars` - autonomous cars

Have fun!

### Write the following queries:

**1.**

Let’s examine the three tables.

```
SELECT * FROM trips;

SELECT * FROM riders;

SELECT * FROM cars;
```

What are the column names?

Stuck? Get a hint

**2.**

What’s the primary key of `trips`?

What’s the primary key of `riders`?

What’s the primary key of `cars`?

Hint

The primary key of `trips` is `id`.

The primary key of `riders` is `id`.

The primary key of `cars` is `id`.

They have the same name, but they are very different.

**3.**

Try out a simple cross join between `riders` and `cars`.

Is the result useful?

Hint

Suppose these are the three columns we select:

```
SELECT riders.first,
   riders.last,
   cars.model
FROM riders, cars;
```

The result combines each user with every car model. Not so useful.

**4.**

Suppose we want to create a Trip Log with the trips and its users.

Find the columns to join between `trips` and `riders` and combine the two tables using a `LEFT JOIN`.

Let `trips` be the left table.

Hint

If we `LEFT JOIN` on `trips.rider_id` and `riders.id`:

```
SELECT *
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders 
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

The result has a lot of columns.

Suppose, we only want certain columns:

```
SELECT trips.date, 
   trips.pickup, 
   trips.dropoff, 
   trips.type, 
   trips.cost,
   riders.first, 
   riders.last,
   riders.username
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders 
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

**5.**

Suppose we want to create a link between the `trips` and the `cars` used during those trips.

Find the columns to join on and combine the `trips` and `cars` table using an `INNER JOIN`.

Hint

For `INNER JOIN`:

```
SELECT *
FROM trips
JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;
```

The `JOIN` keyword can also be `INNER JOIN`.

**6.**

The new riders data are in! There are three new users this month.

Stack the `riders` table on top of the new table named `riders2`.

Hint

For stacking one dataset on top of another, we use `UNION`:

```
SELECT *
FROM riders
UNION
SELECT *
FROM riders2;
```

### Bonus Questions! Queries and Aggregates:

**7.**

What is the average `cost` for a trip?

Hint

```
SELECT AVG(cost)
FROM trips;
```

The result is 31.915

If we use the `ROUND()` function to round the result to 2 decimal places:

```
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cost), 2)
FROM trips;
```

The average `cost` is $31.92!

**8.**

REBU is looking to do an email campaign for all the irregular users.

Find all the `riders` who have used REBU less than 500 times!

Hint

If we are only searching within the `riders` table:

```
SELECT *
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500;
```


If we want to search in both `riders` and `riders2`, then we might have to do something like this:

```
SELECT *
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500
UNION
SELECT *
FROM riders2
WHERE total_trips < 500;
```

**9.**

Calculate the number of cars that are `active`.

Stuck? Get a hint

**10.**

It’s safety recall time for cars that have been on the road for a while.

Write a query that finds the two cars that have the highest `trips_completed`.

Hint

```
SELECT *
FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC
LIMIT 2;
```
