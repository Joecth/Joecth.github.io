P.S. vim in the same way  
We now have the latest versions of macvim managed by brew. Run brew update && brew upgrade every once in a while to upgrade them.
<!--This includes the installation of the CLI mvim and the mac application (which both point to the same thing).-->


##.vimrc
[Joecth's github](https://github.com/Joecth/gvim_Linux)  setting
Just put .vimrc under $HOME dir (~/), all settings are done (font size, color, theme, etc. )
