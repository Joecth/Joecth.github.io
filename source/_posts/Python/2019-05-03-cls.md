For `classmethod`s, the first parameter is the class through which the class method is invoked with instead of the usual `self` for `instancemethod`s (which all methods in a class implicitly are unless specified otherwise).

Here's an example -- and for the sake of exercise, I added an exception that checks the identity of the `cls` parameter.

```python
class Base(object):
    @classmethod
    def acquire(cls, param):
        if cls is Base:
            raise Exception("Must be called via subclass :(")
        return "this is the result of `acquire`ing a %r with %r" % (cls, param)

class Something(Base):
    pass

class AnotherThing(Base):
    pass

print Something.acquire("example")
print AnotherThing.acquire("another example")
print Base.acquire("this will crash")
```

```python
this is the result of `acquire`ing a <class '__main__.Something'> with 'example'
this is the result of `acquire`ing a <class '__main__.AnotherThing'> with 'another example'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "classmethod.py", line 16, in <module>
    print Base.acquire("this will crash")
  File "classmethod.py", line 5, in acquire
    raise Exception("Must be called via subclass :(")
Exception: Must be called via subclass :(
```
