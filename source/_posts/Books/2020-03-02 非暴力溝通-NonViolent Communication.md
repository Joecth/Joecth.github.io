### 暴力溝通四種模式：

Four modes of violent communication:

道德批判、進行比較、迴避責任、強人所難。

Ethical criticism, comparison, avoidance of responsibility, and tough people.

### 非暴力溝通模式 -- 觀察對方和自己的需要

Non-violent communication mode -- Observe the needs of others and yourself

#### e.g.

和幾個同事在一個小組，需要共同完成一項工作。可有一位同事被大家認為沒有團隊精神，喜”單打獨鬥”。如果我們們用非暴力的思維去思考他的行為，就會發現他喜歡單打獨鬥的背後，一定有他的需要，可能他搞長難度更高的工作、可能他特別渴望獲得尊重。這個時候，我們可以平和引導他說出，他喜歡單打獨鬥的原因，然後綜合大家的需求，找到滿足雙方需求的方法，而不是用道德判斷的暴力溝通方式，覺得他價值觀有問題而去疏遠他。

In a small group with several colleagues, you need to complete a job together. However, one colleague was considered to have no team spirit and liked "single fight alone." If we use non-violent thinking to think about his behavior, we will find that he likes to fight alone and there must be his needs. Maybe he has a more difficult job. Maybe he is particularly eager to get respect. At this time, we can calmly guide him to explain why he likes to fight alone, and then integrate everyone's needs to find a way to meet the needs of both parties, instead of using violent communication methods based on moral judgment, and feel alienated in his values he.

#### 觀察、感受、需要、請求,  

#### Observe, feel, need, request

比如，一位下屬沒有按時提交報表，如果是非暴力溝通的上級，可能會這樣和他交流：

上次的報表應該上週就完成的，可是你在昨天才給到我，我感到有點擔心，因為整體的工作進度可能會被擔誤，我不確定是不是你手頭上的工作太多，還是說你家裡有事情。我希望能幫助你更有效率地工作，可以告訴我你最近有什麼困難嗎？

For example, a subordinate did not submit a report on time. If he is a superior who communicates nonviolently, he may communicate with him like this:

The last report should have been completed last week, but you only gave it to me yesterday. I am a bit worried because the overall work progress may be burdened. I am not sure if you have too much work on hand, or Say you have something at home. I hope to help you work more efficiently. Can you tell me about any recent difficulties?

### 區分觀察 vs 評論 Distinguish observation vs comments

評論為絕對化的；觀察式的不會有反感，要避免絕對化的評論。

觀察結果的表述 -- 加上絕對的時間跟地點

Comments are absolute; observations are not objectionable. Avoid absolute comments. Representation of observations -- together w/ absolute time and place

### 體會表達感受  Express feelings

Thnks about the roots behind feelings

### 找到並表達需求 Find and express needs

### 學會表達請求 Learn to express requests

Refine goals with requests when expressing



##### 例１ E.g.1

”我覺得這項工作我做得不是很好” -- 僅想法，未表達感受

”這項工作沒做好，我很愧疚” -- 表達感受；且適當示弱有助於溝通，是一種有效緩解對立情緒、解決衝突的方法。

"I don't think I did a good job with this job" -- only thoughts, no feelings 

"This job is not done well, I feel guilty" -- expressing feelings; BTW, showing weakness appropriately helps communication, which is an effective way to alleviate conflicts and resolve conflicts.

##### 例２ E.g.2

看到下屬將機密文件隨便放到了辦公桌上，於是對他說：「你將機密文件放到辦公桌上，沒有及時鎖起來，這讓我特別緊張。」

接著，要繼續說「因為我不想讓機密文件存在任何洩密隱患」，這句話，挑明了”需求”。

「那麼，請你下次注意將文件第一時間收到保險箱裡，好嗎？」，這句話，則提出了我們的”請求”。

When seeing my subordinates placing confidential documents on the desk, and said to him, "You placed the confidential documents on the desk and did not lock them in time, which made me particularly nervous.

Then, to continue to say "because I don't want any hidden dangers of confidential documents", this sentence clarifies the "need".

"Then, please pay attention to the documents once after being received and put in the safe as soon as possible, okay?" In this sentence, we made our "request".
